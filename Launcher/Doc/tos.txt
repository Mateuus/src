XXVII. Dispute Resolution.

A. Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Game ("Claim"), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to negotiate any Claim (except those Claims expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Negotiations will begin upon written notice. Riot Games will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us. You will send your notice to Riot Games, Inc., 10736 Jefferson Blvd #622, Culver City, CA, 90230, ATTN: CEO.
B. Binding Arbitration. If the parties are unable to resolve a Claim through negotiations, either you or Riot Games may elect to have the Claim (with the exception of those Claims expressly excluded in Section XXVII.E) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Claims ("AAA Consumer Rules"). 
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. 
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Riot Games will pay all arbitration fees and expenses in the event the arbitrator determines those costs to be excessive. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Riot Games may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND RIOT GAMES ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. 
C. Location. Any arbitration will take place in Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America with the understanding that any party may attend the arbitration by video, phone and/or internet connection. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and Riot Games agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
D. Restrictions. You and Riot Games agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Riot Games and you individually. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND RIOT GAMES AGREE THAT (1) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (2) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS; AND (3) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.
E. Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration. You and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games' intellectual property rights; (2) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.
F. Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be is governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For players who access the Game from outside of the United States, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above, and in such an event, shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. In such a case, this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. If you access the Game from New Zealand, and are a resident of New Zealand, The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 ("Act") may apply to the Game as supplied by Riot Games to you. If the Act applies, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, you may have rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. 
G. Severability. You and Riot Games agree that if any portion this Section XXVII is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XXVII.E), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XXVII.E is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Riot Games will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XXVII.E found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco, State of California, United States of America, and you and Riot Games agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
